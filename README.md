<h1>Takeaway</h1>
    
With my only previous experience with Wordpress being the simple consumer drag and drop usage for free themes, 
this project was definitely a huge shock to the system.  It was great discovering how much there actually is that goes into 
developing a custom wordpress theme/site, and how flexible they really are.  This project truly taught me how important it 
is to stay organized with a considerably large amount of files, as not staying in control of all of your selectors would 
inevitably lead to a styling fiasco, and an unnecessary amount of time and work. This project is by far my largest-scale 
project to date, which gave me a great opportunity to practice my existing programming skills, along with learning PHP, 
and some great new tools (MAMP, Wordpress, custumizable fieldsets and plugins, etc).  Not only am have I taken a liking to 
PHP, but I am genuinely excited about using wordpress in the future!
